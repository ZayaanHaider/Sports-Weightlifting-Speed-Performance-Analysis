# Sports-Weightlifting-Speed-Performance-Analysis
This project explores the relationship between strength, speed, and explosiveness in competitive athletes using NFL Combine–style performance data. The analysis focuses on how upper-body strength (bench press repetitions), sprint speed (40-yard dash), and lower-body explosiveness (broad jump) interact across different athlete profiles.
